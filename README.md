# Predicting-University-Admission-with-Regression-Models-Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forest-Models

# Project Description
This project develops several model that predict the liklihood of accpetance into a graduate program at a university. The specific models that I train and evaluate in this project are the following: a linear regression model, a neural network model, a decision tree classifier, and a random forest model. This project is a learning exercise, and is taken from Ryan Ahmed's course, "University Admission Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression".

# Dependencies, Libraries, and Modules
Python 3, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.

# Research Problems
The primary problem is the following: Can we develop an accurate regression model for predicting the liklihood of acceptance into a graduate program at a specific university?

However, in order to answer the primary reserach problem we must answer several secondary questions that include: (A) What kind of model is best? (B) Which features of the dataset serve as the best predictors? and (C) What evaluation metrics will be used? (D) Is the available dataset appropriate for our purpose?

Note that the possible predictors available are the set of features concerning a particular student's (1) academic profile, and (2) strength of her application materials. These features include:

GRE score (a numeric score out of 340)
TOEFL score (a numeric score out of 120)
The university ranking (a numeric score out of 5)
Statement of purpose - i.e., the "SOP" document
The strength of the applicant's letter of recommendation (LORs) (a score out of 5)
Undergraduate GPA (a numveric score out of 10)
Research experience (a binary score of either 1 or 0, where 1 represents having research experience and 0 represents a lack of research experience).
